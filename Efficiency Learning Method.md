Here are some learning methods I summarized as a freshman that may provide some insights:

**Please noteâ˜… : All the methods mentioned below can be found with detailed descriptions on Zhihu. I simply integrated the useful ones and added more self-thinking.**

**Learning Methods Themselves:**

1. Pay attention to logic in class. 
   * How does the professor link one concept to another? 
   * How do they string different concepts together?  
2. Record your own understanding in your own words/style
3. Do practice problems to solidify knowledge and gain deeper understanding  
4. View topics from a research perspective by exploring literature (search papers online to deeply understand interesting concepts brought up in class)

**Grasping the Logic of Knowledge:** 
Understand (preview, post-lecture) â†’ Express clearly (verbally recap) â†’ Teach clearly (teach back method/Feynman Technique)
<u>Do today's tasks today; today you don't know, tomorrow you will</u> 

**Time Management_Seeing Results:**

1. Get more large blocks of time by scheduling independent tasks after large time blocks and important tasks within them. Avoid social media, chatting, games during study time. 
2. Use fragmented time for thinking, flashcards, documentaries. Avoid unproductive socializing, fiction, and games. 
3. Identify peak focus periods and schedule important steps then.

**Energy Management:**  

1. Sleep, white noise 
2. Boost energy with positive emotions
3. Phones deplete rather than replenish energy
4. 35-40min breaks help replenish  

**Also focus on good sleep and exercise habits.**

* All time, energy management and learning methods are meant to enhance thinking. Outputs are just means to an end - to strengthen thought and thus memory and understanding. Varied study spaces, exercise, early sleep and rhythms along with subject switching using the Pomodoro Technique all help our minds think better. Longer study times and efficiency improve allow more time for thinking.  
* Good moods and health best support learning.

**Reflection on Past Poor Performance 1:**  

1. Unproductive socializing broke focus and time  
2. Tutoring others broke time
3. Poor sleep quality  
4. Didn't utilize the 2/8 rule to prioritize key steps
5. Last-minute cramming less effective than spaced review

**Improved Methods 1:**

1. Connect concepts in class  
2. Review after class
3. Standardize workflows for similar questions
4. Consider multiple solutions 
5. Optimize homework schedules, drafts, timing
6. Record notes and thoughts daily; focus review weekly before exams using mind maps
7. Use spaced review on exams/homework during exams

**Reflection on Past Poor Performance 2:**  

1. Initially retained high school habits and worked diligently but started understanding after midterms. 

2. Improved methods and planned effective final exam review, achieving good results.

**Existing Gaps 2:** 

1. Didn't value smaller courses (majors set tier, minors the depth)
2. Could have earned more daily points (homework completion and class engagement)  

3. Initially undervalued textbook series content (practice questions, slides, readings)  
4. Didn't form reviewing habit

**Improved Methods 2:**  

1. Excel in every course
2. Plan daily points goals after first week
3. Maximize daily points (95+)  
4. Complete practice and slides daily
5. Aim for perfection on all assignments  
6. Efficient pre-class preparation
7. Pay attention to logic in class
8. Intentional practice to reinforce understanding; use own words; review

**Use Multi-Layered Learning Methods:**

1. Recapping's role: Assist thinking

2. Note-taking's role: Help recap, thinking, memory 

3. Mind maps' purpose: Assist thinking, memory

4. Problems: Assist thinking, simulate exams

5. Log unclear issues, fragmented time Q&A: Assist thinking

6. Accept-think-internalize knowledge, ask post-class:

     - What knowledge is tested?

     - Do I know/master it? 

     - How to apply this knowledge?
       etc. Increase thinking.

7. Focus on the core 80% of a concept; spend remaining 20% on other areas.

**Other Tips:**

1. Schedule according to natural energy cycles 
2. Exercise and take regular breaks
3. Use diverse modalities - visual, auditory, mixed
4. Interleave multiple topics/subjects  
5. Stay hydrated, eat healthy
6. White space is valuable - less screen time



# ðŸš€ Formulas for Improving Efficiency and Motivation 

Understanding and applying the two formulas below is critically important in pursuing goals and improving personal efficiency. Here is an in-depth explanation of these two formulas and how to apply them to optimize your work and learning methods.

## ðŸ’ª The Motivation Formula

First, let's look at the first formula, which I call the "**Motivation Formula**." The core of this formula is that when you are dissatisfied with the current situation, looking forward to the future, and clear on the specific next steps, you can overcome obstacles and take action:

Dissatisfaction with the current situation **x** Looking forward to the future **x** Clear next steps **>** Obstacles  

- **Clear next steps** should be precise down to a specific detail or timepoint rather than vague statements about completing something.
- Reading biographies of successful people can help generate dissatisfaction with the current situation and outlook towards the future.

## ðŸ§  The Flow Formula

Next is the second formula, which I call the "**Flow Formula**." When the following conditions are met, you won't just take action - you'll maintain high efficiency after taking action as well:  

Clear goals **+** Timely feedback **+** Balance of skills and challenges **=** Flow

- **Clear goals:** You need to clearly understand the specific tasks at hand and not consider possible outcomes.
- **Timely feedback:** For example, if writing a paper, feedback can come from reviewers and advisors.  
- **Balance of skills and challenges:** Let the challenges be slightly higher than your skills, i.e. challenges = skills + 1, so tasks are engaging yet achievable and help enter a flow state.

## Additional Tips:

1. When in a flow state, you typically won't feel the passage of time. Your focus should be completely on the current task for 2-4 distraction-free hours.
2. **Enter flow by addition:** Increase dopamine and norepinephrine to make tasks more engaging. Simply put - utilize **curiosity + passion + purpose**.  
3. **Enter flow by subtraction:** Reduce cognitive load by transferring extra mental resources to focus fully on the task, minimize distractions from social media etc.
