Revision Materials for the Third Year of Undergraduate Studies in Computer Science at Central South University

1. Please use these materials reasonably and appropriately without abuse. Independent learning is encouraged.
2. I intend to help more people pursue their dreams and not waste their prime years on unnecessary coursework.
3. I have taken many high-quality online courses from foreign universities. You may be interested in taking a look at my course collection repository: https://github.com/FeijiangHan/cs_courses
4. Lab exercises are not provided. It is recommended that you complete them on your own and do additional explorations.
5. You can utilize my organized key learning points to locate important topics quickly. Feel free to ditch less important areas and devote more time to meaningful activities.
6. If possible, please star some of my other projects as well. Several contain course designs and hot research topics.


Looking back on the road behind me, I regret spending too much time grinding for grades.
I hope these materials can save you some time from grade grinding, so please allocate more of your energy to programming practice and scientific research. That is what you should focus on.
However, grade grinding also has its merits. In my third year, my class rank rose by 22 places. Anything is possible if you start hustling now - keep pushing forward!

P.S. I am currently preparing to study abroad. When the time comes, I will write a post about my experience abroad and preparation for English proficiency tests.
Please feel free to ask any questions about learning in the issues section. All are welcome to contribute additional materials to build an even better learning environment.


**中南大学CS大三学年的复习资料**

1. 合理利用，不要滥用，自主学习

2. 我的本意只是帮助更多的人追逐自己的梦想，不要把大好年华浪费在无用的课程上
   
4. 我上过很多优质国外网课，感兴趣可以看我的这个仓库：https://github.com/FeijiangHan/cs_courses

5. 不传实验，建议自己搞花样、做扩展
   
6. 可以借用我整理的重点快速定位学习要点，适当放弃不重要的地方，把更多的时间放在有意义的事情
   
7. 如果方便的话请给我的其他几个项目点点star吧，里面有一些是课设和热点研究哦~ 

回望走过的路，我很后悔花费了很多时间在卷绩点上，我希望这些资料可以节约一些你们卷绩点的时间，请把更多的时间放在编程训练和科研上吧，这才是你应该做的。

不过卷绩点也是有意义的，大三一年我排名升了22名，一切皆有可能，现在开始冲刺为时不晚，加油！

ps. 我最近在准备出国，等到时候写一篇出国记录和准备英语考试的帖子。
